# Pre Interview Assignment
(Solution utilizes Angular 8 and core 3.0)
 To run:
 - clone/download the code
 - open solution file in visual studio 2019
 - run the solution
 
 the process may take a few minutes as npm needs to restore packages

 user credentials are provided on login screen but you may create a new account if you wish

 The project could use better documentation however due to time constraints I've cut the dev off to make sure I'm not too late
